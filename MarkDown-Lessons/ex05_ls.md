# Exercise 5

In this exercise you learn how to list the contents of a directory with the ls command.

## :neckbeard: Do This

Before you start, make sure you `cd` back to the directory above `temp`. If you have no idea where you are, use `pwd` to figure it out and then move there.

## :computer: Linux/OSX

```bash
$ cd temp
$ ls
stuff
$ cd stuff
$ ls
things
$ cd things
$ ls
orange
$ cd orange
$ ls
apple
$ cd apple
$ ls
pear
$ cd pear
$ ls
$ cd grape
$ ls
$ cd ..
$ ls
grape
$ cd ../../../
$ ls
orange
$ cd ../../
$ ls
stuff
$
```

## ðŸ–¥ Windows

```bash
> cd temp
> ls


    Directory: C:\Users\zed\temp


Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
----                -------------     ------ ----

## :memo: You Learned This

The `ls` command lists out the contents of the directory you are currently in. You can see me use `cd` to change into different directories and then list what's in them so I know which directory to go to next.

There are a lot of options for the `ls` command, but you'll learn how to get help on those later when we cover the help command.

## :hurtrealbad: Do More

Type every one of these commands in! You have to actually type these to learn them. Just reading them is not good enough. I'll stop yelling now.
On Unix, try the `ls -lR` command while you're in `temp`.

On Windows do the same thing with `dir -R`.
Use `cd` to get to other directories on your computer and then use `ls` to see what's in them.
Update your notebook with new questions. I know you probably have some, because I'm not covering everything about this command.
Remember that if you get lost, then use `ls` and `pwd` to figure out where you are, then go to where you need to be with `cd`.
