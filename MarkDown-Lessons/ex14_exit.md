# Exercise 14

## :computer: Linux/OSX

```bash
$ exit
```

## ðŸ–¥ Windows

```bash
> exit
```

## :memo: You Learned This

Your final exercise is how to exit a Terminal. Again this is very easy, but I'm going to have you do more.

## :see_no_evil: Do More

For your last set of exercises I'm going to have you use the help system to look up a set of commands you should research and learn how to use on your own.

### Here's the list for Unix

* `xargs`
* `sudo`
* `chmod`
* `chown`

### For Windows look up these things

* `forfiles`
* `runas`
* `attrib`
* `icacls`

Find out what these are, play with them, and then add them to your index cards.
