# Exercise 13

In this exercise you learn how to remove (delete) a file using the `rm` command. Do the following in _**your**_ terminal..

## :computer: Linux/OSX

```bash
$ cd temp
$ ls
uncool.txt  iamcool.txt  neat.txt  something  thefourthfile.txt
$ rm uncool.txt
$ ls
iamcool.txt  neat.txt  something  thefourthfile.txt
$ rm iamcool.txt neat.txt thefourthfile.txt
$ ls
something
$ cp -r something newplace
$
$ rm something/awesome.txt
$ rmdir something
$ rm -rf newplace
$ ls
$
```

## ðŸ–¥ Windows

```bash
> cd temp
> ls

## :bulb: You Learned This

Here we clean up the files from the last exercise. Remember when I had you try to `rmdir` on a directory with something in it? Well, that failed because you can't remove a directory with files in it. To do that you have to remove the file, or recursively delete all of its contents. That's what you did at the end of this.

## :bomb: Do More

* Clean up everything in temp from all the exercises so far.
* Write in your notebook to be careful when running recursive remove on files.
