# Exercise 1

In this lesson we will do _three_ things:

1. Do some things in your shell (command line, Terminal, PowerShell).
2. Learn about what you just did.
3. Do more on your own.

For this first exercise you'll be expected to get your Terminal open and working so that you can do the rest of the exercises.

## Do This

Get your Terminal, shell, or PowerShell working so you can access it quickly and know that it works.

## Mac OSX

For Mac OSX you'll need to do this:

* Hold down the command âŒ˜ key and hit the spacebar.
* In the top right the blue "search bar" will pop up.
* Type: terminal
* Click on the Terminal application that looks kind of like a black box.
* This will open Terminal.
* You can now go to your dock and CTRL-click to pull up the menu, then select Options->Keep In dock.
* Now you have your Terminal open and it's in your dock so you can get to it.

## Linux

I'm assuming that if you have Linux then you already know how to get at your Terminal. Look through the menu for your window manager for anything named "Shell" or "Terminal."

## Windows

On Windows we're going to use PowerShell. People used to work with a program called `cmd.exe`, but it's not nearly as usable as PowerShell. If you have Windows 7 or later, do this:

* Click Start.
* In "Search programs and files" type: powershell
* Hit Enter.

If you don't have Windows 7, you should _seriously_ consider upgrading. If you still insist on not upgrading then you can try installing it from Microsoft's download center. Search online to find "powershell downloads" for your version of Windows. You are on your own, though, since I don't have Windows XP, but hopefully the PowerShell experience is the same.

## You Learned This

You learned how to get your Terminal open so you can do the rest of this exercise.

## Do More

This exercise has a large "do more" part. The other exercises are not as involved as this one, but I'm having you prime your brain for the rest of the exercise by doing some memorization. Just trust me: this will make things silky smooth later on.

## Linux/Mac OSX

Take this list of commands and create index cards with the names on the left on one side, and the definitions on the other side. Drill them every day while continuing with the lessons in this course.

command | definition
--------|-----------
pwd | print working directory
hostname | my computer's network name
mkdir | make directory
cd | change directory
ls | list directory
rmdir | remove directory
pushd | push directory
popd | pop directory
cp | copy a file or directory
mv | move a file or directory
less | page through a file
cat | print the whole file
xargs | execute arguments
find | find files
grep | find things inside files
man | read a manual page
apropos | find what man page is appropriate
env | look at your environment
echo | print some arguments
export | export/set a new environment variable
exit | exit the shell
sudo | DANGER! become super user root DANGER!

## Windows Commands

If you're using Windows then here's your list of commands:

command | definition
--------|-----------
pwd | print working directory
hostname | my computer's network name
mkdir | make directory
cd | change directory
ls | list directory
rmdir | remove directory
pushd | push directory
popd | pop directory
cp | copy a file or directory
robocopy | robust copy
mv | move a file or directory
more | page through a file
type | print the whole file
forfiles | run a command on lots of files
dir -r | find files
select-string | find things inside files
help | read a manual page
helpctr | find what man page is appropriate
echo | print some arguments
set | export/set a new environment variable
exit | exit the shell
runas | DANGER! become super user root DANGER!

Drill, drill, drill! Drill until you can say these phrases right away when you see that word. Then drill the inverse, so that you read the phrase and know what command will do that. You're building your vocabulary by doing this, but don't spend so much time else you go nuts and get bored.
